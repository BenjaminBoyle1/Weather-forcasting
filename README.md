# Overview

As a software engineer, my aim is to continually enhance my skills and understanding of different programming languages. In this project, I developed a weather forecast web application to showcase my proficiency in JavaScript.

The software I wrote is a simple web app that fetches weather forecasts based on user-entered locations using the OpenWeatherMap API. It allows users to input a location and retrieve current weather information, including temperature, description, and humidity.

The purpose of writing this software was to deepen my understanding of JavaScript language syntax and APIs. By creating this application, I aimed to demonstrate my ability to interact with APIs, handle user input, and dynamically update HTML content using JavaScript.

# Development Environment

To develop this software, I used the following tools:
- Visual Studio Code: A versatile code editor with excellent support for JavaScript development.
- Google Chrome: For testing and debugging the web application.

The programming language used for this project was JavaScript, along with HTML and CSS for the frontend. Additionally, I utilized the Fetch API to make HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API for weather data.

# Useful Websites

During the development of this project, I found the following websites helpful:
- [OpenWeatherMap API Documentation](https://openweathermap.org/api): Provides comprehensive documentation on how to use the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript): An invaluable resource for JavaScript syntax, methods, and best practices.

# Future Work

In the future, I plan to:
- Implement error handling to gracefully manage cases of invalid user input or failed API requests.
- Enhance the user interface with additional features such as icons or animations.
- Allow users to view extended weather forecasts for multiple days.
- Incorporate geolocation to automatically fetch weather data based on the user's current location.
